# Lua State Format 1.0

The Lua State Format is specified to create a method of storing the execution state of a Lua Program in a well-defined manner. This could then be loaded into another Lua Runtime and execution can continue from the point it was saved. 

## Structure of the Format

A Lua State File is composed of the following structure

```
struct lua_state_file{
	lua_state_header header;
	lua_constantpool constants;
	lua_objectpool liveObjects;
	lua_functionpool liveFunctions;
	lua_threads threads;
	lua_executionstate state;
};
```

### Header
The header of a Lua State file is defined by the following structure

```
struct lua_state_header{
	u8 magic[4];
	version ver;
	version luaVer;
};
```

magic MUST be the bytes `[FF 4C 55 41]`. 

ver encodes the version of the Lua State Save Specification which the file was created in. 
This is encoded in the LCLib Versioning format, where the major value indicates the major version-1, and the minor value indicates the minor version. 
The current version of the specification is 1.0, and therefore the version for a file created in this version is [00 00]. 

luaVer encodes the Lua Version the file is created for.
