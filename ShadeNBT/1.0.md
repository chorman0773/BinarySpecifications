# ShadeNBT Version 1.0 #

Released: 2018-05

Description: ShadeNBT is a modification on the standard Named Binary Tag Specification, created for the Game Minecraft. 
The format is used to protection against corrupt game files, as well as to ensure Binary Version Compatibility. 
The format contains a 6-bit header, which declares that the file is a ShadeNBT File, followed by a well-formed uncompressed NBT File, that contains a single, nameless compound tag. 

A Variation of this Specification, known as CryptoShade, provides Strong, Password-based Encryption of the enclosed NBT File and MAY additionally be supported by conforming implementations.

## Structure of a Shade Save File ##

### Header ###

Each Shade file shall contain a header, which is defined by the following structure:

```
shade_head{
	u8 magic[4];
	{
		u8 major;
		u8 minor;
	}ver;
}
```

magic MUST be exactly the bytes [AD 4E 42 54], or the file is malformed.

ver encodes the version of the ShadeNBT Specification which the file was created in. 
This is encoded in the LCLib Versioning format, where the major value indicates the major version-1, and the minor value indicates the minor version. 
The current version of the specification is 1.0, and therefore the version for a file created in this version is [00 00]. 


Conforming Implementations MUST Document at least 1 supported version, and support all versions with the same major version number and a lesser or equal minor version number as each of those supported versions. 

Conforming Implementations SHOULD support the latest version of the Specification released at the time the Implementation was created or updated.
